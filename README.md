For any questions or support, please reach out to us at support@pullupapp.com.
We provide a wrapper to launch npm.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
./npmw install
```

We use npm scripts and [Angular CLI][] with [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./mvnw
./npmw start
```

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `./npmw update` and `./npmw install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `./npmw help update`.

The `./npmw run` command will list all the scripts available to run for this project.

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

The service worker initialization code is disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `src/main/webapp/app/app.config.ts`:

```typescript
ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: false }),
```

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

```
./npmw install --save --save-exact leaflet
```

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

```
./npmw install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet
```

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Edit [src/main/webapp/app/app.config.ts](src/main/webapp/app/app.config.ts) file:

```
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
```

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss](src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss) file:

```
@import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using Angular CLI

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

```
ng generate component my-component
```

will generate few files:

```
create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
update src/main/webapp/app/app.config.ts
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the pullUpApp3 application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify
```

### JHipster Control Center

JHipster Control Center can help you manage and control your application(s). You can start a local control center server (accessible on http://localhost:7419) with:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-control-center.yml up
```

## Testing

### Spring Boot tests

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

```
./npmw test
```

## Others

### Code quality using Sonar

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off forced authentication redirect for UI in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

Additionally, Instead of passing `sonar.password` and `sonar.login` as CLI arguments, these parameters can be configured from [sonar-project.properties](sonar-project.properties) as shown below:

```
sonar.login=admin
sonar.password=admin
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

### Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
npm run java:docker
```

Or build a arm64 docker image when using an arm64 processor os like MacOS with M1 processor family running:

```
npm run java:docker:arm64
```

Then run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

When running Docker Desktop on MacOS Big Sur or later, consider enabling experimental `Use the new Virtualization framework` for better processing performance ([disk access performance is worse](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/7)).

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
